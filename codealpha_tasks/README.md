## 1. Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them

## 2. Unemployment Analysis with Python ðŸ“Š

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project.

## 3. Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning ðŸš—

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn
how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

## 4. Sales Prediction using Python ðŸ’¼

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product. So letâ€™s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.

### Objective

The primary objective of these tasks is to enhance my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and Python programming while gaining hands-on experience in tackling real-world problems.
